With everything we do online, there's a vast amount of sensitive information at risk: email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and much more.

With the Information Security Certification, you'll build a secure web app with HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online.

You'll also build a TCP client, and an Nmap and port scanner in Python. This will help you learn the basics of penetration testing â€” an important component of good information security.
